## FrontEnd
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

## Database server
Currently we have the database configured locally and can connect to it via a locally running database management system, specifically MySQL. Ask Mark how to set it up if you want to set it up. Otherwise this will be updated when we have an established relational database service i.e. amazon aurora
